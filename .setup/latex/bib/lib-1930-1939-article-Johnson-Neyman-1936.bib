  abstract = {Beginning with the general ideas of testing hypotheses developed by Neyman and Pearson and using certain recent results of S. Kolodziejczyk, the problem of matched groups is discussed and a numerical illustration given. It is shown that the problem of matched groups may be generalized so that both a more detailed analysis of the experimental data and a greater accuracy of results is obtained. In treating this problem the idea of ``region of significance''' is introduced to educational and psychological investigations. The methods proposed, however, are quite general and not limited to problems in these fields.},
